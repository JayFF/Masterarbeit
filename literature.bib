	abstract = {Transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors represent elementary components of layered heterostructures for emergent technologies beyond conventional optoelectronics. In their monolayer form they host electrons with quantized circular motion and associated valley polarization and valley coherence as key elements of opto-valleytronic functionality. Here, we introduce two-dimensional polarimetry as means of direct imaging of the valley pseudospin degree of freedom in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Using {MoS}2 as a representative material with valley-selective optical transitions, we establish quantitative image analysis for polarimetric maps of extended crystals, and identify valley polarization and valley coherence as sensitive probes of crystalline disorder. Moreover, we find site-dependent thermal and non-thermal regimes of valley-polarized excitons in perpendicular magnetic fields. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of wide-field polarimetry for rapid inspection of opto-valleytronic devices based on atomically thin semiconductors and heterostructures.},

	abstract = {{MoTe}2 belongs to the semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide family with certain properties differing from the other well-studied members (Mo,W)(S,Se)2. The optical band gap is in the near-infrared region, and both monolayers and bilayers may have a direct optical band gap. We first simulate the single-particle band structure of both monolayer and bilayer {MoTe}2 with density-functional-theory-{GW} calculations. We find a direct (indirect) electronic band gap for the monolayer (bilayer). By solving in addition the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we find similar energies for the direct exciton transitions in monolayers and bilayers. We then study the optical properties by means of photoluminescence ({PL}) excitation, reflectivity, time-resolved {PL}, and power-dependent {PL} spectroscopy. With differential reflectivity, we find a similar oscillator strength for the optical transition observed in {PL} in both monolayers and bilayers suggesting a direct transition in both cases. We identify the same energy for the B-exciton state in the monolayer and the bilayer. Following circularly polarized excitation, we do not find any exciton polarization for a large range of excitation energies. At low temperatures (T=10K), we measure similar {PL} decay times on the order of 4 ps for both monolayer and bilayer excitons with a slightly longer one for the bilayer. Finally, we observe a reduction of the exciton-exciton annihilation contribution to the nonradiative recombination in bilayers.},

The energy separation between the singlet and triplet states has been found to be relatively small reflecting rather weak effects of the electron-electron exchange interaction for the trion triplet in a {WS}\$\_2\$ monolayer, which involves two electrons with the same spin but from different valleys. Polarization-resolved experiments demonstrate that the helicity of the excitation light is better preserved in the emission spectrum of the triplet trion than in that of the singlet trion. Finally, the singlet (intravalley) trions are found to be observable even at ambient conditions whereas the emission due to the triplet (intervalley) trions is only efficient at low temperatures.},

Conventional transfer techniques that involve stamping, lift-off and/or striping suffer from the process-specific drawbacks, such as the requirement for chemical etchant or high-temperature annealing and the introduction of surface discontinuities and/or contaminations that can greatly hinder the properties and functions of the transferred materials. Herein, we report a universal and rapid transfer method implementable at mild conditions. Nanostructures with various dimensionalities (i.e. nanoparticles, nanowires and nanosheets) and surface properties (i.e. hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can be facilely transferred to diverse substrates including hydrophilic, hydrophobic and flexible surfaces with good fidelity. Importantly, our method ensures the rapid and clean transfer of two-dimensional (2D) materials, and allows for the facile fabrication of vertical heterostructures with various compositions used for electronic devices. We believe that our method can facilitate the development of nano-electronics by accelerating the clean transfer and integration of low-dimensional materials into multidimensional structures.},

	abstract = {\#\#\# {BACKGROUND}

Materials by design is an appealing idea that is very hard to realize in practice. Combining the best of different ingredients in one ultimate material is a task for which we currently have no general solution. However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and {III}-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities.

\#\#\# {ADVANCES}

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., {NbSe}2), semiconductors (e.g., {MoS}2), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride ({hBN})]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.

A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.

When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.

Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with {hBN} allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.

The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with {hBN}. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes.

\#\#\# {OUTLOOK}

Currently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition ({CVD}), direct growth of heterostructures by {CVD} or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable.

Production of van der Waals heterostructures.
Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks ( top ) has now evolved to large-scale growth by {CVD} or physical epitaxy ( bottom ).



The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices—such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes—are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.

	abstract = {Transparent polymers have great potential when applied toward flexible devices as encapsulation or substrate materials in the fields of electronics, optics, biology, and so on because of their low costs and lightweight. The use of polymeric materials in bonding technology is indispensable due to the practicality of these materials. In general, polymer bonding can be achieved through the use of interlayer-like adhesives or through direct bonds such as ultrasonic or thermocompression bonding. Polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}) joints were achieved by surface modification via oxygen-argon plasma. Plasma treatment at various plasma power levels (150, 200, 250, and 300 W) was conducted on the {PDMS} surface with the modified surfaces being analyzed via contact angle measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Plasma-activated {PDMS} films were bonded without adhesives at 160 °C, which did not lead to deformation. The bond strength of the plasma-activated {PDMS} was measured using a T-peel test prior to and after bending cycles, and the optical transmittance of the specimens was also measured. The fractured surface was investigated via optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy following adhesion testing. The experimental results revealed that the bond strength of {PDMS} was proportional to the employed plasma power level. The bond strength of {PDMS} decreased by approximately 10.8\% after 100 000 bending cycles, indicating that plasma polymerization-assisted direct bonding could function as a versatile bonding method for polymeric materials.

A decrease in film thickness to the ultimate limit of the atomic, sub-nanometre length scale, a difficult limit for traditional semiconductors (such as Si and {GaAs}), would bring wide benefits for applications in ultrathin and flexible electronics, photovoltaics and display technology. For this, transition-metal dichalcogenides ({TMDs}), which can form stable three-atom-thick monolayers, provide ideal semiconducting materials with high electrical carrier mobility, and their large-scale growth on insulating substrates would enable the batch fabrication of atomically thin high-performance transistors and photodetectors on a technologically relevant scale without film transfer. In addition, their unique electronic band structures provide novel ways of enhancing the functionalities of such devices, including the large excitonic effect, bandgap modulation, indirect-to-direct bandgap transition, piezoelectricity and valleytronics. However, the large-scale growth of monolayer {TMD} films with spatial homogeneity and high electrical performance remains an unsolved challenge. Here we report the preparation of high-mobility 4-inch wafer-scale films of monolayer molybdenum disulphide ({MoS}2) and tungsten disulphide, grown directly on insulating {SiO}2 substrates, with excellent spatial homogeneity over the entire films. They are grown with a newly developed, metal–organic chemical vapour deposition technique, and show high electrical performance, including an electron mobility of 30 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature and 114 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 90 K for {MoS}2, with little dependence on position or channel length. With the use of these films we successfully demonstrate the wafer-scale batch fabrication of high-performance monolayer {MoS}2 field-effect transistors with a 99\% device yield and the multi-level fabrication of vertically stacked transistor devices for three-dimensional circuitry. Our work is a step towards the realization of atomically thin integrated circuitry.},

Electrical contact to graphene is normally done with metal contacts on its flat face, where there are few strong bonding sites for the metal. Wang et al. (p. 614) encapsulated graphene with hexagonal boron nitride sheets and made metal contacts along its edge, where bonding orbitals are exposed. The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit.
Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.
Metal contacts to graphene along its edge improve bonding and, in turn, electronic performance.

In particular, if there are two or more minima in the conduction band (or maxima in the valence band) in momentum space, and if it is possible to confine charge carriers in one of these valleys, then it should be possible to make a valleytronic device. Valley polarization, as the selective population of one valley is designated, has been demonstrated using strain and magnetic fields, but neither of these approaches allows dynamic control. Here, we demonstrate that optical pumping with circularly polarized light can achieve complete dynamic valley polarization in monolayer {MoS}2 (refs 11, 12), a two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric crystal with direct energy gaps at two valleys. Moreover, this polarization is retained for longer than 1 ns.

For bilayer and trilayer {WSe}2, we observe an increase in the photoluminescence intensity and a blue shift of the photoluminescence peak positions after oxygen plasma treatment. The photoluminescence spectra of trilayer {WSe}2 exhibit features of a bilayer after oxygen plasma treatment. Bilayer {WSe}2 exhibits features of a monolayer, and the photoluminescence of monolayer {WSe}2 is completely absent after the oxygen plasma treatment. These changes are observed consistently in more than 20 flakes. The mechanism of the changes observed in the photoluminescence spectra of {WSe}2 is due to the selective oxidation of the topmost layer. As a result, N-layer {WSe}2 is reduced to N–1 layers. Raman spectra and {AFM} images taken from the {WSe}2 flakes before and after the oxygen treatment corroborate these findings. Because of the low kinetic energy of the oxygen radicals in the remote oxygen plasma, the oxidation is self-limiting. By varying the process duration from 1 to 10 min, we confirmed that the oxidation will only affect the topmost layer of the {WSe}2 flakes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the surface layer {WOx} of the sample can be removed by a quick dip in {KOH} solution.

	abstract = {The research on emerging layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide ({MoS}2), reveals unique optical properties generating significant interest. Experimentally, these materials were observed to host extremely strong light-matter interactions as a result of the enhanced excitonic effect in two dimensions. Thus, understanding and manipulating the excitons are crucial to unlocking the potential of 2D materials for future photonic and optoelectronic devices. In this review, we unravel the physical origin of the strong excitonic effect and unique optical selection rules in 2D semiconductors. In addition, control of these excitons by optical, electrical, as well as mechanical means is examined. Finally, the resultant devices such as excitonic light emitting diodes, lasers, optical modulators, and coupling in an optical cavity are overviewed, demonstrating how excitons can shape future 2D optoelectronics.},

Among them, semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides, {MX}2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se), have bandgaps in the near-infrared to the visible region, in contrast to the zero bandgap of graphene. In the monolayer limit, these materials have been shown to possess direct bandgaps, a property well suited for photonics and optoelectronics applications. Here, we review the electronic and optical properties and the recent progress in applications of 2D semiconductor transition metal dichalcogenides with emphasis on strong excitonic effects, and spin- and valley-dependent properties.

The recent emergence of layered materials provides a laboratory for studying the interplay between internal quantum degrees of freedom of electrons. Here we report new coupling phenomena connecting real spin with layer pseudospins in bilayer {WSe}2. In polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements, we observe large spin orientation of neutral and charged excitons by both circularly and linearly polarized excitation, with the trion spectrum splitting into a doublet at large vertical electrical field. These observations can be explained as a locking of spin and layer pseudospin in a given valley, where the doublet implies an electrically induced spin splitting. The observed distinctive behaviour of the trion doublet under polarized excitation further provides spectroscopic evidence of interlayer and intralayer trion species, a promising step towards optical manipulation in van der Waals heterostructures through interlayer excitons.},

Recent advances in two-dimensional crystals have created opportunities to manipulate nonlinear processes electrically. Here we report a strong second-harmonic generation ({SHG}) in a 2D {WSe}2 bilayer crystal caused by a back gate field. This unusual process takes place only when the gate polarity causes charge accumulation rather than depletion. Analysis based on a bond–charge model traces the origin of {SHG} to the nonuniform field distribution within a single monolayer, caused by the accumulated submonolayer screening charge in the tungsten plane. We name this phenomenon charge-induced {SHG} ({CHISHG}), which is fundamentally different from the field- or current-induced {SHG}. Our findings provide a potentially valuable technique for understanding and noninvasive probing of charge and current distributions in future low dimensional electronic devices.},

A thorough characterization of the transport properties demonstrates the high quality of these devices for both electron and hole accumulation, which enables the quantitative determination of the band gap (Δ1L = 2.14 {eV} for monolayers and Δ2L = 1.82 {eV} for bilayers). It also enables the operation of the transistors in the ambipolar injection regime with electrons and holes injected simultaneously at the two opposite contacts of the devices in which we observe light emission from the {FET} channel. A quantitative analysis of the spectral properties of the emitted light, together with a comparison with the band gap values obtained from transport, show the internal consistency of our results and allow a quantitative estimate of the excitonic binding energies to be made. Our results demonstrate the power of ionic liquid gating in combination with nanoelectronic systems, as well as the compatibility of this technique with optical measurements on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. These findings further open the way to the investigation of the optical properties of these systems in a carrier density range much broader than that explored until now.},

Our devices show n-type behavior with a high room-temperature on/off current ratio of ∼106. They show clear metallic behavior at high charge carrier densities and mobilities as high as ∼140 cm2/(V s) at low temperatures (above 300 cm2/(V s) in the case of bilayers). In the insulating regime, the devices exhibit variable-range hopping, with a localization length of about 2 nm that starts to increase as the Fermi level enters the conduction band.

A detailed characterization as a function of temperature and magnetic field clearly shows the occurrence of a gate-induced superconducting transition below a critical temperature Tc ≈ 4 K, a finding that represents the first demonstration of superconductivity in tungsten-based semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. We investigate the nature of superconductivity and find significant inhomogeneity, originating from the local detaching of the frozen ionic liquid from the {WS}2 surface. Despite the inhomogeneity, we find that in all cases where a fully developed zero resistance state is observed, different properties of the devices exhibit a behavior characteristic of a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, as it could be expected in view of the two-dimensional nature of the electrostatically accumulated electron system.},

Contrary to the {TX}2 monolayers, spin-orbit splittings and valley polarization are absent in bilayers due to the presence of inversion symmetry. This symmetry can be broken by an electric field, and the spin-orbit splittings in the valence band quickly reach values similar to those in the monolayers (145 {meV} for {MoS}2,..., 418 {meV} for {WSe}2) at saturation fields less than 500 {mV} Å−1. The band gap closure results in a semiconductor-metal transition at field strength between 1.25 ({WX}2) and 1.50 ({MoX}2) V Å−1. Thus, by using a gate voltage, the spin polarization can be switched on and off in {TX}2 bilayers, thus activating them for spintronic and valleytronic applications.},

By measuring the fluorescence quantum yields, we also establish the radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of the direct and indirect excitons. The exciton decay in monolayered {WS}2 exhibits a strong excitation density-dependence, which can be described using an exciton–exciton annihilation (two-particle Auger recombination) model. The exciton–exciton annihilation rate for monolayered, bilayered, and trilayered {WS}2 was determined to be 0.41 ± 0.02, (6.00 ± 1.09) × 10−3 and (1.88 ± 0.47) × 10−3 cm2 s−1, respectively. Notably, the exciton–exciton annihilation rate is two orders of magnitude faster in the monolayer than in the bilayer and trilayer.

Such coupling not only gives rise to the spin Hall effect and spin circular dichroism in inversion symmetric bilayer, but also leads to a variety of magnetoelectric effects permitting quantum manipulation of these electronic degrees of freedom. Oscillating electric and magnetic fields can both drive the hole spin resonance where the two fields have valley-dependent interference, making possible a prototype interplay between the spin and valley as information carriers for potential valley-spintronic applications.

Dipolar selection rules of Coulomb-correlated electrons and holes in the conduction and valence band with identical valley index result in spin-allowed and spin-forbidden optical transitions of excitons with zero center-of-mass momentum. The corresponding spectral signatures, however, are insufficient to explain the realm of characteristic peaks observed in the photoluminescence spectra of {ML} {TMDs} on the basis of momentum-direct excitons alone. Here, we show that the notion of these momentum-indirect excitons is the key to the understanding of the versatile photoluminescence features. Taking into account phonon-assisted radiative recombination pathways for electrons and holes from dissimilar valleys, we interpret unidentified peaks in the emission spectra as acoustic and optical phonon sidebands of momentum-dark excitons. Our approach represents a crucial step towards a unified understanding of {TMD} photophysics and will facilitate the interpretation of optical, valley and spin phenomena in {TMDs} arising from bright and dark exciton manifolds.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides ({TMDs}) are emerging as a new platform for exploring 2D semiconductor physics1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Reduced screening in two dimensions results in markedly enhanced electron–electron interactions, which have been predicted to generate giant bandgap renormalization and excitonic effects10,11,12,13. Here we present a rigorous experimental observation of extraordinarily large exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconducting {TMD}. We determine the single-particle electronic bandgap of single-layer {MoSe}2 by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ({STS}), as well as the two-particle exciton transition energy using photoluminescence ({PL}) spectroscopy. These yield an exciton binding energy of 0.55 {eV} for monolayer {MoSe}2 on graphene—orders of magnitude larger than what is seen in conventional 3D semiconductors and significantly higher than what we see for {MoSe}2 monolayers in more highly screening environments. This finding is corroborated by our ab initio {GW} and Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations14,15 which include electron correlation effects. The renormalized bandgap and large exciton binding observed here will have a profound impact on electronic and optoelectronic device technologies based on single-layer semiconducting {TMDs}.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of degeneracies arising from crystal symmetries, it is possible for electron states at band-edges (‘valleys’) to have additional spin-like quantum numbers1,2,3,4,5,6. An important question is whether coherent manipulation can be performed on such valley pseudospins, analogous to that implemented using true spin, in the quest for quantum technologies7,8. Here, we show that valley coherence can be generated and detected. Because excitons in a single valley emit circularly polarized photons, linear polarization can only be generated through recombination of an exciton in a coherent superposition of the two valley states. Using monolayer semiconductor {WSe}2 devices, we first establish the circularly polarized optical selection rules for addressing individual valley excitons and trions. We then demonstrate coherence between valley excitons through the observation of linearly polarized luminescence, whose orientation coincides with that of the linearly polarized excitation, for any given polarization angle. In contrast, the corresponding photoluminescence from trions is not observed to be linearly polarized, consistent with the expectation that the emitted photon polarization is entangled with valley pseudospin. The ability to address coherence9,10, in addition to valley polarization11,12,13,14,15, is a step forward towards achieving quantum manipulation of the valley index necessary for coherent valleytronics.},

	abstract = {Monolayer ({ML}) transition metal dichalcogenides ({TMDs}) undergo substantial changes in the single-particle band structure and excitonic optical response upon the addition of just one layer. As opposed to the single-layer limit, the bandgap of bilayer ({BL}) {TMD} semiconductors is indirect which results in reduced photoluminescence with richly structured spectra that have eluded a detailed understanding to date. Here, we provide a closed interpretation of the elementary optical responses of {BL} {WSe}\$\_2\$ as a representative material for the wider class of {TMD} semiconductors. By combining theoretical calculations with comprehensive spectroscopy experiments, we identify the crucial role of momentum-indirect excitons for the understanding of basic absorption and emission spectra ubiquitously exhibited by various {TMD} {BLs}. Our results shed light on the origin of quantum dot ({QD}) formation in monolayer and bilayer crystals and will facilitate further advances directed at opto-electronic applications of layered {TMD} semiconductors in van der Waals heterostructures and devices.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06623},
	abstract = {The strong light-matter interaction in transition Metal dichalcogenides ({TMDs}) monolayers ({MLs}) is governed by robust excitons. Important progress has been made to control the dielectric environment surrounding the {MLs}, especially through hexagonal boron nitride ({hBN}) encapsulation, which drastically reduces the inhomogeneous contribution to the exciton linewidth. Most studies use exfoliated {hBN} from high quality flakes grown under high pressure. In this work, we show that {hBN} grown by molecular beam epitaxy ({MBE}) over a large surface area substrate has a similarly positive impact on the optical emission from {TMD} {MLs}. We deposit {MoS}\$\_2\$ and {MoSe}\$\_2\$ {MLs} on ultrathin {hBN} films (few {MLs} thick) grown on Ni/{MgO}(111) by {MBE}. Then we cover them with exfoliated {hBN} to finally obtain an encapsulated sample : exfoliated {hBN}/{TMD} {ML}/{MBE} {hBN}. We observe an improved optical quality of our samples compared to {TMD} {MLs} exfoliated directly on {SiO}\$\_2\$ substrates. Our results suggest that {hBN} grown by {MBE} could be used as a flat and charge free substrate for fabricating {TMD}-based heterostructures on a larger scale.},
