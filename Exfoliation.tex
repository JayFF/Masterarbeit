The fabrication of a functioning field effect structure of \tmdg mono- or bilayers roughly consists of three different procedures. The production of suitible flakes of \tmd's, the preparation of an electrode both on the sample and in the substrate and the assembly of the full device on top of it.

\end{figure}
Thin films of \tmds\!, like many natomaterials, can be fabricated using a top-down or bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach for these particular materials is called chemical-vapor deposition (\textsc{cvd})\cite{chen_chemical_2016}. Because of its scalability it is the leading candidate that could be used in an industrial fabrication pipeline. However, the top-down approach of mechanical exfoliatioin has become the first choice for a lot of projects to build high quality model systems, that can be used to study physics in low dimensions\cite{geim_rise_2007}. The reason is the so far supperior quality of few-layer flakes in terms of defects and contaminants as well as the synergy with dry transfer methods(Reference(Laterchapter)). 

The mechanical exfoliation process -- oftern referred to as the ``scotch tape method'' -- is based on the fact, that the van-der-Waals forces between adjacent layers in \tmd's are much weaker, than the lateral covalent bonds inside them. In fact, they are weak enough, that they can be easily broken appart by adhesive tape. The starting point is a solid crystal of \tmd-material, that can be produced either naturally or synthetically with high purity (supplied by hq-graphene). When a stripe of adhesive tape is brought in contact with it, a small amount can be peeled off. With a second stripe, that is put on the first one, the process is repeated multiple times. Each time, the fresh tape is peeled of its parent, the strong adhesion between tape and \tmdg ensures a clean interface. Three to four repetitions are an optimum to produce monolayers of a useful size. More repetitions further thin the material but heighten the risk of these thin films to break to smaller peaces, which complicates processing the flakes later on and build larger devices. 

To prepare monolayer flakes for the assembly of more complex devices, they first have to be transferred onto a suitible substrate. In this work, this substrate is silicon with a layer of thermal oxide that is between 50 and 90 nm thick. Before wafers of this material are brought in contact with the exfoliation tapes they are cleaned both in acetone and isopropanole before being exposed to oxygen plasma for 180 s. This ensures a clean surface and maximizes the material that sticks to the wafer(Reference). After the tape is in contact, the wafer is heated to 90°C. After cooling down the tape can be peeled off and the wafer is inspected for monolayers. As seen in [Figure], during this process a large number of flakes of different sizes and thicknesses are transferred and it is uncommon to find more than one monolayer of suitible size on a wafer of 10 by 10 mm.

	\caption{Comparison of mono- and bilayers of WSe$_2$. \textbf{A} The reflectance contrast of mono- and bilayers can be used to measure the layer number. The difference is however small enough to misidentify them under changing or inhomogenious lighting conditions. \textbf{B} The monolayer shows much higher \textsc{pl}-intensity than the bilayer and can therefore be identified very easily.}
	\label{pl-contrast}
\end{figure}

Under an optical microscope monolayers can be identified using the optical contrast and the color. It is possible to verify the layer number by this criteria alone using a camera and image analysis software\cite{funk_spectroscopy_2017}, however this is much more reliable on transparent substrates, since the optical contrast is higher and the lighting conditions can be controlled more precisely. With our optical microscope and \si/\sio substrates, monolayer candidates where instead verified using photoluminescence (\textsc{pl}) imaging(Referenz Andre). Because of the direct band-gap, monolayers of \tmd's are much more efficient emitters than even bilayers with almost an order of magnitude difference in \textsc{pl}-intesity. The result can be seen in Figure \ref{pl-contrast}. The sample is excited with a laser with a wavelength above the A-exciton resonance and only the \textsc{pl} is collected on the chip of a \textsc{usb}-camera. A detailled description of the optical setup can be found in (Optical Setup). As can be seen, the \textsc{pl}-image clearly identifies the monolayer-regions through bright intensity, while the bilayer region of the flake is not visible at all. On the microscope picture on the other hand, both regions do not differ much in color and reflectance and can be tricky to tell appart, especially when the lighting is inhomogenious or changes over time.

Other methods to idetify monolayers inlcude both photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy\cite{zhao_lattice_2013,zhang_phonon_2015,tonndorf_photoluminescence_2013}. However, for assembling devices and verifying the quality of exfoliated flakes, \textsc{pl}-imaging proved to be the fastest and most versatile method.

\section{Hexagonal boron nitride}

For spectroscopic studies of \tmd's the right substrate plays a very crucial parts. As discussed in section \ref{theory_exciton}, the ultrathin geometry of \tmdg monolayers makes them very sensitive to the dielectric environment. To obtain a narrow linewith of the spectral features both in reflection and \pl spectroscopy, a suitable substrate not only has to have a minimal roughness on the surface that should ideally be atomically flat, to avoid modulation of the band structure through strain. Also, the substrate has to be dielectrically calm to avoid pertubation of excitons by dangling bonds, that reduce lifetimes and broaden the spectral lines. Both criteria rule out traditional substrates such as \si and \sio. In recent years hexagonal boron nitride (\hbn) has proven to be the supperior choice to observe narrow linewidth spectra in \tmd's\cite{courtade_spectrally_2018}. \textsc{Hbn}, just like \tmds is a layered material, but belongs to the class of 2\textsc{d}-isolators, with a large, indirect band gap in the \textsc{uv}-range\cite{arnaud_huge_2006}. Thin, flat layers of \hbng can be mechanically exfoliated and can achieve large, flat terraces. Few layers are sufficient to shield a \tmdg sample from the underlying substrate. To achieve even narrower lines, it can be ``sandwiched'' between two flakes of flat \hbng as was done with all samples contributing to this thesis. From the standpoint of nanofabrication \hbng has another important property. The van-der-Waals forces at \hbn-\tmdg interfaces are stronger than between a \tmdg sample and \sio. This enables the hot pick up assembly, discussed in section \ref{hot_pickup}.

\section{Electrode fabrication}

The goal of this thesis was, to fabricate high quality \tmd-monolayer samples that are gate-tunable, meaning control over the charge density inside the monolayer flake leveraging the field effect. The problem of designing such a device can be understood as using the 2D-material as one plate of a capacitor, and charging it, by applying a voltage. The other plate or ``back-gate'' in this analogy is the conducting boron-doped silicon substrate. Flake and substrate are separated by a 50nm layer of thermal silicon-dioxide, that functions as the dielectric of the gate-structure. Both the sample on top and the back-gate have to be contacted to allow the application of a voltage.

	\label{pattern}
\end{figure}

In many gated devices, that incorporate \tmd-monolayers, the gate electrodes are actually fabricated directly onto the sample as a last step(Referenzen). While the fabrication of contacts can be more precisely tailored in this way, the big drawback is the exposure of the monolayers to a lot of chemicals like photoresist and developer, that can contaminate the sample and lower its quality. Therefore in this work a more simple approach was chosen. Instead of writing contacts after transfer, contacts are fabricated beforehand. The encapsulated \hbn-\tmd-heterostructure can be contacted by dropping it on the edge of the gold structure. The gold patterns are created using contact lithography using a chromium mask, deposited on glass. Because the heterostructure can be dropped at any point on the substrate, the precise shape of the gold structure is unimportant. Therefore no new lithographic mask had to be fabricated. Instead a suitable mask was chosen from old preused structures. The downside is, that these masks can deteriorate over time and over many uses, but because of the low requirements for the electrodes all its defects manifest themselves in a purely aesthetic manner and do not affect its functionality. The process starts with spin coating \textsc{az}701-photoresist on a \si/\sio wafer. Using the blabla-Maskaligner, the wafer is brought in contact with the mask before exposing it to \textsc{uv}-light for 18 seconds. After that, the pattern is developed using blabla-developer, that washes out the exposed photoresist.

In the next step, the sample is coated in an X-ray evaporation system. First, a 1-5nm film of titanium is deposited on the substrate, that acts as a bonding agent. Subsequently a 50nm film of gold is deposited ontop, that forms the actual top-gate electrode. After removing the sample from the high-vacuum chamber the undevelopped photoresist is removed in the so called ``lift-off''. The substrate is simply bathed in acetone, that desolves the resist below most of the deposited gold and only the structures in the developped areas remain. To speed up the lift-off process, the sample can be placed in an ultrasonic cleaner at a low power. The resulting structure can be seen in Figure \ref{pattern}.

Once the distance between the wires and the substrate is low enough, an electric arc will form, when the capacitor discharges through the substrate. The heat from the current liquifies the tip of the gold wire, which diffuses inside the silicon and ``smears out'' the semiconductor/metal-interface.}\label{arc}
\end{figure}

Silcon is a semiconductor. A simple contact with a metal wire therefore results in a Schottky barrier at low temperatures even with a moderately doped substrate like the ones used in this thesis. To create an ohmic contact, to the backgate, the semiconcutor/metal interface is ``smeared out'' by diffusing boron doped gold into the substrate. This is achieved by applying a voltage (20 V to 30 V) between two gold wires and bringing them close to the substrate. Because the \si substrate has a higher conductivity than the ambient air, an arc discharge between the tips of the wires will preferably find its way through the substrate. When the arc forms upon bringing the wires very close to the substrate and each other the ohmic heat will liquify the tips of the wires and inject gold into the topmost layers of the silicon. This creates a gradual metal-semiconductor interface and avoids a Schottky barrier.

This process can be very violent. Gold droplets can splash over a large distance and gold can not only diffuse into the backgate but can also contaminate the \sio dielectric, lowering the breakdown voltage significantly. Therefore this step in the fabrication process should be taken before assembling the \tmd-\hbng heterostructure. This way, the substrate can be replaced in case of failure.

\section{Hot pick-up and transfer}\label{hot_pickup}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Stempelaufbau.png}

	\caption{Setup for hot pick-up and stamping.

	\label{stamping-setup}
\end{figure}

The mechanical exfoliation method is popular also for its synergy with dry transfer methods. \textsc{Cvd}-grown \tmd-flakes are grown on suitible substrates and can be transferred to target substrate using a variation of wet methods, that involve powerful solvents or a combination of solvents and polymer films to lift the grown flakes off their initial substrate \cite{li_universal_2014}. The advantage of the exfoliation method in this regard is that flakes can be put on any substrate directly from the adhesive tape. That led to the invention of ``viscoelastic stamping'', where the \tmd-material is exfoliated on a substrate of viscoelastic polymer called polydimethylsiloxane (\textsc{pdms})\cite{castellanos-gomez_deterministic_2014}. This so called ``stamp'' could then be brought in contact with the target substrate and peeled off carefully to drop down the flake at a desired position, opening up the possibility of producing carefully designed heterostructures deterministically.

The use of \hbng to provide an optimal dielectric environment opened up the possibility of using the van-der-Walls forces between \hbn and 2D-materials not only to drop down exfoliated layers, flake by flake but to pick up 2D-materials with \hbn-flakes, inreasing the yield as well as ensuring very clean interfaces, free of contaminants from the polymer stamp. 

The method used for this work is called ``hot pick-up and stamping''\cite{pizzocchero_hot_2016, tien_study_2016}. The stamp used in this process is a block of \textsc{pdms}, mounted on a glass slide with transparent adhesive tape. This block is spin-coated with a polymer polypropylene carbonate (\textsc{ppc}). To make sure, that the polar \textsc{ppc} sticks to the stamp while being heated to high temperatures it is treated in oxygen plasma for at least 20 minutes before spin coating\cite{jung_adhesion_2016}.

The \tmd-flake is exfoliated on a \si/\sio substrate and so are suitible bottom and top \hbn flakes. The primary criteria for finding the right \hbn-flakes is the flattness of its surface, so that the \tmd-flake can be encapsulated between two large terasses without cracks or steps. To allow a fast fabrication process, this flattness is only judged with help of an optical microscope. More sophisticated methods like atomic force microscopy can be used to verify the flattness more accurately, however this not only extends the fabrication process but does not help determining the quality of the top \hbn flake, since its interface is facing down after being exfoliated on the parent substrate.

The goal of the hot pick-up is now to use a hot-plate to control the van-der-Waals forces between \hbn, \tmds and the substrate to ensure adhesion between the parts of the heterostructure as well as to reduce contamination with water molecules from the ambient air.

After all precursors are prepared on \si/\sio substrates, the actual pick-up and stamping process can be carried out. The fabrication setup can be seen in (Figure whatever). The first step is the pick-up of the top \hbng flake. At 40°C the van-der-Waals forces between \hbng and \textsc{ppc} are already strong enough to lift the flake off the silicon substrate. In the next step the \hbng is dropped dropped on the \tmd-flake. To make the interface as clean as possible the temperature for this drop is raised to 110°C. This ensures a stronger van-der-Waals force between \hbng and \tmdg than between \tmdg and silicon-dioxide but more importantly contamination through droplets of water from the ambient air is minimized above its boiling point and other contaminants are more mobile as well. By slowly pressing the stamp against the substrate, this dirt can leave the interface of the two flakes and fewer blisters form(hotpickuppaper). The stack of \tmdg and \hbng can then be picked up again following the same procedure that was used for the bare \hbng flake. Afterwards it is dropped down on the bottom \hbng flake. To contact the \tmdg flake to gold part of it has to remain outside the \hbng encapsulation. This part does not necessarily have to be a monolayer but can also be any form of \tmdg, that is in contact with it so charges can be transported. The \hbng on the other hand is elastic enough so that thicker material does not affect the encapsulation of mono- or bilayer regions.

The last step is to transfer the whole stack to its final position in contact with the electrodes. This is accomplished by repeating the pick-up process once again and dropping the stack in contact with the gold structure.

Despite the strong plasma treatment of the \textsc{pdms}-stamp in some cases the \textsc{ppc} can peel off during the drop down part of the transfer due to high heat as the polymer becomes ever more liquid. In this case the sample can be carefully treated with acetone, which dissolves the polymer rapidly. The sample subsequently has to be cleaned in isopropanole and blown dry with nitrogen gas. 

\subsection{Annealing}

While the hot pick-up should in theory ensure a \hbn-\tmdg interface free of contamination, especially contamination due to humidity in the ambient air can remain between the layers and seriously lower the quality of the sample. To remove this pollution, the sample can be annealed\cite{lin_graphene_2012}. During annealing, the sample is placed in an annealing oven. While maintaining a high vacuum of 10$^{-3}$ mbar, the oven heats the sample to 250°C for three hours. Other recipes, that use higher or lower temperatures or longer annealing times can work just as well. Since the hot pick-up technique should keep the \tmdg surfaces clean of anything but the ambient air, the only concern is water, which is removed more easily than other contaminands. 
More aggressive recipes, that work at higher temperatures or for longer times to remove also polymer contaminations that arise from contact to the stamp and therefore have a limited advantage over milder annealing conditions, but raise the risk of damaging the sample through temperature induced strain, that can potentially rip the \tmdg flakes.

\section{Electrical characterization}

To assess the quality of the the gate structure, its breakdown voltage has to be determined. This is the voltage between top gate and back gate, at which the leakage current starts to rise exponentially by forming conducting channels through the dielectric, that are self-sustaining and lift the conductance permanently\cite{klein_maximum_1966}. This breakdown voltage complicated to predict, as it is a nonlinear effect mainly caused by faults in the \sio layer. Thus it does not only depend on the thickness of the dielectric but also on the area of the top gate, because the statistical chance of a conducting channel forming is higher the more area of the sample is covered with conducting material. Additionally the rather violent ohmic contacting of the backgate can also damage the dielectric and lower the breakdown voltage. Therefore each sample has to be classified before being used to tune the charge density in spectroscopy. The dielectric in samples used throughout this thesis had a thickness of 50 nm or 90 nm, corresponding through a predicted breakdown voltage of 47.5 V or 85.5 V respectively. To assert these values, the leakage currents have to be monitored while ramping up the voltage. Before breakdown these currents are of the order of 100 pA to 1 nA and can be measured using a lock-in amplifier. A constant voltage across the desired range of operation ({\small$\pm $}30V) is added to a small \textsc{ac}-voltage of small amplitude ($U_0 = $ 10 mV$_{pp}$, $f = $ 77.1 Hz). A diagram of the circuitry is drawn in figure \ref{cv}. The real part of the resulting current is the resistive current, or leakage and the imaginary part is proportional to the capacity. Both parts can be measured and monitored in the lock-in amplifier. The \textsc{dc}-voltage is ramped until the leakage rises exponentially. At this point, the currents are still small enough to not inflict permanent damage to the dielectric and give the safe range of positive ad negative voltages during operation during the experiment.
