\chapter{Summary \& outlook}

The goal of this thesis was to establish a frabrication pipeline for narrow linewidth \tmdg monolayers, encapsulated in \hbn, embedded in a gate-structure. This was accomplished by combining the dry transfer technique of ``hot pick-up and stamping'' with contact lithography and mechanical exfoliation.

\textsc{Tmd} monolayers were produced by mechanically exfoliating material from a bulk crystal with adhesive tape. To obtain narrow linewidths they were encasulated in \hbng flakes by picking up \hbng and \tmdg flakes one by one with a \textsc{ppc}-coated \pdms-stamp and dropped in contact with lithographically written gold wires. To verify the function and determine the maximum gate voltage the leaking current through the samples was measured using a lock-in amplifyer.

A combined gate-tunable mono- and bilayer sample of tungsten diselenide was analyzed by means of confocal laser spectroscopy. Both reflection and photoluminescence spectra were taken while speeping the gate voltage to determine intrinsic doping and observe the transition between neutral and negative charge carrier density.

The observed spectral linewidth of 6--7 meV for the neutral exciton peak are a significant imporvement over previous samples, especially because these values can be observed on most of the sample. However, because the intrinsic homogenious linewidth is believed to be only a third of this value, there is still room for improvement.

Nevertheless, the good linewidth-related resulutin helped to gain insight about the origin of the different spectral features as gate voltage sweeps were repeated for high positive and negative magnetic fields. The observed $g$-factors were used to distinguish between the negatively charged trion state and a not yet fully understood strong feature in the neutral spectrum and their related lower energy peaks.

The $g$-factors of previously unidentified peaks could help to verify our model, that identifies them as phonon replica of momentum-indirect excitons. However, this will have to be completed by other measurements including life-time measurements, power dependence but most of all theoretical predictions of $g$-factors. The same procedures can also be performed on other \tmds\!---for example the closely related \ws\!. During the work for this thesis, a sample of \ws with an optimal gate-tunability was already produced and can be analyzed in the future.

But there are also possible advancements in the fabrication process and sample engineering. Uncontrolled thickness of the bottom \hbng flake as well as the 50-90 nm \sio dielectric mean, that in order to create significant electric field strengths, high voltages close to the breakdown have to be applied to observe the transistion between all relevant regimes. Because of negative intrinsic doping only the neutral and negative regime could be resolved in this thesis. However, there are viable options to navigate this limitation. One option is to integrate top and backgate into the heterostructure itself. Using graphene beneath the bottom \hbng flake or above the top the distance between the gates could be substancially lowered. The result would be a much higher field strength close to the monolayer. The other option would be to still use the substrate as backgate but to discard \sio as a dielectric. Using techniques such as atomic layer deposition of materials like aluminum oxide, a similar effect could be achieved, without raising the complexity of the van-der-Waals heterostructure.

But also the present techniques could be used to build new interesting samples. Stacking different \tmdg monolayers on top of each other to form gate-tunable heterobilayers could yield a better understanding of features like second-harmonic generation and layer-indirect excitons. A challange would be to align the crystal axis of the precursor monolayers, but this could also be an opportunity to study moir√© effects in more detail.
